# ITG Awards

My entry to the ITG awards 2018

### QUOTE
"When we started out, everyone said we should smarten ourselves up and be more like Led Zeppelin. Then we got to Britain and they told us we should be more like the Sex Pistols. Then it was Metallica and then Nirvana. We always had the same answer to all of them: 'sorry, mate, not interested.' We're AC/DC. And we think they should all be more like us."
— Malcolm Young, Metal Hammer 90's interview.
 
Malcolm's really underrated. He makes the band sound so full, and I couldn't ask for a better rhythm player. Sometimes I look at Malcolm while he's playing, and I'm completely awestruck by the sheer power of it. He's doing something much more unique than what I do—with that raw, natural sound of his.
